## Background
[Soduku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a fun puzzle game. 

"Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). <br/>
Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, <br/>
without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square."
